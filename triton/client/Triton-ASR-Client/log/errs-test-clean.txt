1257_8230-279154-0001:	WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL (CORRELATES->CORONETS) ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
1258_8230-279154-0002:	WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO (EXCEPTIONS->ACCEPTIONS) EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT (IS->IT) HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN (OVERSTATEMENT->OVER STATEMENT) AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT (IDEAS APPROXIMATELY->I DOES A PROXIMATELY) REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS

1265_8230-279154-0009:	OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST (IN FUNDAMENTAL->INFUNDAMENTAL) CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE

1269_8230-279154-0013:	IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS
126_6829-68769-0052:	HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT (FORGED->FORT) CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
1270_8230-279154-0014:	I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
1271_8230-279154-0015:	THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
1272_8230-279154-0016:	IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE (FEELING->FILLING) OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVENT
1273_8230-279154-0017:	THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC (FEELING->FILLING) WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED
1274_8230-279154-0018:	THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
1275_8230-279154-0019:	IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS
1276_8230-279154-0020:	IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
1277_8230-279154-0021:	REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING (OR->A) RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
1278_8230-279154-0022:	SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
1279_8230-279154-0023:	IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER (VAGUE->VA)
127_6829-68769-0053:	AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
1280_8230-279154-0024:	THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
1281_8230-279154-0025:	WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO (ANALOGUE->ANAGUE) IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED (THOUGH->THOSE) SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO (RANK->WRINK) WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIACY
1282_8230-279154-0026:	THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
1283_8230-279154-0027:	A (GRAMOPHONE->GRANDED) BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM (GRAMOPHONES->GRANFONES) AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
1284_8230-279154-0028:	I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE WHOLLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
1285_8230-279154-0029:	THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
1286_8230-279154-0030:	(SEMON'S->SIMONS) TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
1287_8230-279154-0031:	THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF (PAST OCCURRENCES->PASSCURRENTS AS) COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO (PAST->PASS) OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY
1288_8230-279154-0032:	IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
1289_8230-279154-0033:	IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
128_6829-68771-0000:	SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE (FORBES'S->FOR ITS) AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
1290_8230-279154-0034:	WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT (LEADS->LEASE) US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
1291_8230-279154-0035:	THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
1292_8230-279154-0036:	A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
1293_8230-279154-0037:	RECOGNITION (IN->AND) THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT
1294_8230-279154-0038:	WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS (HAVE->HAD) THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
1295_8230-279154-0039:	THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENSE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
1296_8230-279154-0040:	THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE (THAN->THEN) AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
1297_8230-279154-0041:	THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN (LINKS->LENGTHS) OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
1298_8230-279154-0042:	THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
1299_8230-279154-0043:	OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL (OF->*) THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS RECOGNITION
129_6829-68771-0001:	ONE OF MISTER (HOPKINS'S->HOPKINS) FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMEN AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL (CANVASS->CANVAS) OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED

1302_2961-961-0002:	AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN (TIMAEUS->TO ME AS) CITIZEN OF (LOCRIS->LOCRIUS) WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER (AND->IN) A STATESMAN AND TO YOU (CRITIAS->CRITIUS) WHOM ALL (ATHENIANS->ATHENES) KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO (HERMOCRATES WHO IS->HER MOCREDIES WAS) ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE

1322_2961-961-0022:	THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST (TIMAEUS WHO IS->TO ME AS) A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF (MAN->MEN) AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST ATHENIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN (RECORD->RECORDS) SPOKE

1324_2961-960-0001:	THE INFLUENCE (WITH->WHICH) THE (TIMAEUS->TO ME IS) HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING

1326_2961-960-0003:	THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE (DOMINION->DIMINION) OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY (CHARACTERISTIC->CORRECTORISTIC) IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE AND CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL

1331_2961-960-0008:	WE DO NOT KNOW HOW (PLATO->PLAY TO) WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN (DIALOGUES->DIALECTS) OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO (TRILOGIES->TRIALITIES) WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
1332_2961-960-0009:	THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH (THE ANIMAL->ANY MORE) CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE (HEAVENLY->HEAVILY) BODIES AND WITH (MAN->MEN) ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
1333_2961-960-0010:	BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET (DEFINED->THE FIND) THIS INTERMEDIATE (TERRITORY->TARY TOY) WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT (AN->AND) IMPIETY IN (RANKING->WRINKING) THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
1334_2961-960-0011:	WITH (HERACLEITUS->HERACLITIES) HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE (ANAXAGORAS->AN EXIGARUS) HE (ASSERTS->OBSERTS) THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE (PYTHAGOREANS->PATHOGARIANS) HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER

1336_2961-960-0013:	IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE

135_6829-68771-0007:	THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE (WOMAN'S->WOMEN'S) POLITICAL LEAGUE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE

1365_2300-131720-0019:	THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE (EDISON->ADDICINE) SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND (IT->HE) GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO (INCANDESCENT->INCONDENT) LIGHTING

1369_2300-131720-0023:	I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAN I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE (EDISON->EDICINE) CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
136_6829-68771-0008:	THESE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSIST IN ELECTING MISTER FORBES

801_7021-79730-0000:	THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT
802_7021-79730-0001:	TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN (EFFECTING->AFFECTING) SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
803_7021-79730-0002:	BY REASON AND AFFECTION
804_7021-79730-0003:	AS THE (CHAISE->CHASE) DRIVES AWAY (MARY->MERRY) STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE (DOOR STEP->DOORSTEP) HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR SURGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE (DELICATE->DELEGATE) ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS (AN IRREPARABLE->AND A REPARABLE) INJURY
805_7021-79730-0004:	THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE (CHAISE->CHASE) IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER (COUNTENANCE->CONFIDENCE) GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION (UPON->ON) HER FACE AT THE (INGENUITY->ENGINITY) AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE
806_7021-79730-0005:	SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT (WILL->WE'LL) STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
807_7021-79730-0006:	THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY (RELIES->REALIZE) PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
808_7021-79730-0007:	IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
809_7021-79730-0008:	BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
80_6829-68769-0006:	IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE (FORGED->FORT) CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
810_7021-79730-0009:	IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION (CAN NOT->CANNOT) BE OVERRATED
811_7021-79759-0000:	NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
812_7021-79759-0001:	THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
813_7021-79759-0002:	THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
814_7021-79759-0003:	VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
815_7021-79759-0004:	WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE (ON REFLECTION->UNREFLECTION) HOW VAST (AN->AND) INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION (IN->AND) MATURE (YEARS->*) MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD (IMPRESSES->IMPRESS) UPON THE MIND
816_7021-79759-0005:	THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
817_7021-79740-0000:	TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
818_7021-79740-0001:	(DELLA->DELA) HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED (MARIA->REA) AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
819_7021-79740-0002:	NOW (DELIA->DILA) CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND (ASCENDENCY->ASCENDANCY) OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
81_6829-68769-0007:	BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I (DOUBT IF->DOUB OF) SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE
820_7021-79740-0003:	TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
821_7021-79740-0004:	YOU HAVE COME (ANDELLA ANDELLA->AND DLA AND DELA) WAS THE NAME OF (JANE'S DOLL->JANE STILL) TO MAKE (ROSALIE A->ROSALIA) VISIT

823_7021-79740-0006:	I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL (ANDELLA->AND DELA) SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
824_7021-79740-0007:	THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE
825_7021-79740-0008:	FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER (PLAYTHINGS->PLAY THINGS) AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
826_7021-79740-0009:	THEY WERE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOR
827_7021-79740-0010:	(DELIA->DELU) CAME TO THE PARLOR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE (ANDELLA->AND TELL) AND ROSALIE HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
828_7021-79740-0011:	SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A (CIRCUITOUS ROUTE->CIRCULUS ROOT) TO THE PIAZZA THERE
829_7021-79740-0012:	SAID SHE POINTING TO THE (PLAYTHINGS->PLAY THINGS) SEE
82_6829-68769-0008:	(FAIRVIEW->FAIRVIE) WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY (JAIL->TRAIL)
830_7021-79740-0013:	PUT THESE (PLAYTHINGS->PLAY THINGS) ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW (ANY THING->ANYTHING) ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
831_7021-79740-0014:	AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM (DISPOSED->DISPOSE) TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
832_1284-1180-0000:	HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE (KNEE->NIE) PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD

835_1284-1180-0003:	FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF (OZ->AWES) IN WHICH THEY LIVED
836_1284-1180-0004:	WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE (UNC SIMPLY->UNSIMPLY) LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
837_1284-1180-0005:	NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF (ANYONE->ANY ONE) CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
838_1284-1180-0006:	AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE (MUNCHKINS->MUNCHINS) FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE (GILLIKINS->GILLAKENS) THE PATH DIVIDED
839_1284-1180-0007:	HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS (THEIR->THERE) NEAREST (NEIGHBOR->NEIGHBOUR)
83_6829-68769-0009:	THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAMED MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER
840_1284-1180-0008:	ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON (UNC AND->*) OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD (MUNCHKIN->MAN SKIN) HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
841_1284-1180-0009:	THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPT
842_1284-1180-0010:	(UNC KNOCKED->UNCONNOCKED) AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE

846_1284-1180-0014:	(OJO->O JO) HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE
847_1284-1180-0015:	WE ARE TRAVELING REPLIED (OJO->OLD) AND WE STOPPED AT YOUR HOUSE JUST (TO->A) REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES
848_1284-1180-0016:	THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
849_1284-1180-0017:	(AT->*) ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG (FOUR->FOR) KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
84_6829-68769-0010:	WE WISH TO TALK WITH HIM ANSWERED KENNETH TALK
850_1284-1180-0018:	IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE (MARGOLOTTE->MARGULAT) WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
851_1284-1180-0019:	YOU MUST KNOW SAID (MARGOLOTTE->MARGUA) WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD (MOMBI->MAMBY) THE WITCH WHO USED TO (LIVE->LEAVE) IN THE COUNTRY OF THE (GILLIKINS->GILLEQUINS) TO THE NORTH OF (HERE->HE)
852_1284-1180-0020:	THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS CAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
853_1284-1180-0021:	I THINK THE NEXT GLASS (CAT THE->CABIN) MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND (MAY->THEY) PROVE OF SOME USE TO US

861_1284-1180-0029:	SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND (COLORS->COLOURS) ARE SO MIXED UP
862_1284-1180-0030:	WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE (MUNCHKINS->MUNCHINS) ARE
863_1284-1180-0031:	AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS (OZMA LIVES->O'S MALICE) GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOR

868_1284-1181-0003:	THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS
869_1284-1181-0004:	GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON METAL IN THE LAND OF (OZ->AWES) AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT (AND PLIABLE->IMPLIABLE)

876_1284-1181-0011:	VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT (ALL TOGETHER->ALTOGETHER) IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH (A->THE) GOLDEN SPOON
877_1284-1181-0012:	NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL (WERE->WE'RE) LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD
878_1284-1181-0013:	(OJO->O JO) BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
879_1284-1181-0014:	HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
87_6829-68769-0013:	(MAY WE SEE->MAYBE) GATES AT ONCE ASKED KENNETH
880_1284-1181-0015:	MOST PEOPLE (TALK->TAUGHT) TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
881_1284-1181-0016:	I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A (CROOKED->CROAKED) STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE

883_1284-1181-0018:	IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN
